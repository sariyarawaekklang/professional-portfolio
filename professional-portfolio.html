                    Hello, my name is Sariya Rawaekklang. I am from a small town in Missouri and I moved to San Antonio in 2020 with the dreams of becoming a physician assistant.
                    I graduated from the University of Missouri-Kansas City with a Bachelors of Health Science in 2019 and also work as a CNA for three years.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Software development and software engineering caught my eye as I came to realize the medical field was not where I belong. 
                    I decided to take a huge leap in life and change my career path, which is what prompted me to enroll in a six-month coding bootcamp at the University of Texas at San Antonio.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Aside from my professional life, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and spending time with family. 
                    I am a powerlifter; I love visiting new gyms with my boyfriend. 
                    I am also a huge boba enthusiast. 
                </p>
